## Lit-Apps

```
CAUTION: 

THIS IS VERY EARLY SOFTWARE - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION - VERY LIKELY TO CHANGE
```

Lit-apps an ecosystem of [lit-based](lit.dev) applications.

It will contain: 
- tools, helpers and utilities for building applications.
- a series of ready-to use (and augment) lit applications or application components (like menu, footer, sign-in elements) that  integrate easily together. 

The main idea is to allow to compose those components for building complex apps or application ecosystems. 

### Current state

- [x] @lit-app/state - a state management library for lit-based applications (see [packages/state/README.md](packages/state/README.md))
